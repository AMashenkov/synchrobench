INSTALL
------- 
To install Synchrobench go to the root directory and type 'make'.
This will compile the basic lock-based and lock-free data structures of the C/C++
version of Synchrobench that will be located in synchrobench-c/bin/

* Transactional Memories:
  To test transaction-based version, a TM implemenation must be provided.
  The easiest is to use a software library as follows:
   1. Install an STM library: 
      (e.g., http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~gramoli/tmp/doc/sw/estm-0.3.0.tgz) 
      Compile the STM
   2. Set ./common/Makefile.common
      - libatomic_ops directory (LIBAO)
      - STM directories (e.g., ESTMDIR)
   3. Compile with E-STM using 
        make estm
  Other TM libraries are available online:
     - TinySTM   http://tmware.org/tinystm
     - SwissTM   http://lpd.epfl.ch/site/research/tmeval
     - E-STM     http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~gramoli/php/estm.php

* Locks:
  Alternatively, you can directly use the lock-based versions 
  (without using any STM) by compiling the mutex or spinlock 
  versions as follows:
     make lock 
     make spinlock

RUN

   1. Executables for double-ended queue, hash table, linked list, 
      red-black tree, skip list, speculation-friendly binary search tree, 
      using no synchronization (sequential), using read-modify-write
      (lock-free), mutex, spinlock, transactional memory (ESTM)
      are located in 'bin':
      ./bin/sequential-deque
      ./bin/sequential-hashtable
      ./bin/sequential-linkedlist
      ./bin/sequential-rbtree 
      ./bin/sequential-skiplist
      ./bin/sequential-sftree

      ./bin/lockfree-rbtree 
      ./bin/lockfree-skiplist-fraser
      ./bin/lockfree-skiplist-rotating
      ./bin/lockftree-sftree
      ./bin/MUTEX-hashtable
      ./bin/MUTEX-linkedlist
      ./bin/MUTEX-skiplist
